/**
 *   7.62 Routing
 *
 *  Look at the URL passed in the request and choose to give different content based on those different URLs.
 *
 *  Mapping HTTP requests to content whether the content exist on the server, or not.
 *  All the browser is doing is sending an HTTP request.  The URL is one of those pieces of data in the reqeust.
 *  It is up to the server what to do with it.
 *
 *  Maybe the data doesnâ€™t live on the server but in a database.
 *  When we build our routing we are specifying that when the server is sent a request for something specific it gives
 *  something back as a response.
 *  If a file sits on the server then I can connect to it using a stream and stream it back.
 *  How the application deals with the content internally is up to it.
